# Smart-Bench


## Introduction
The aim of the project is to show the development and realization of a smart bench press that monitors the state, performance and health of the atlete during a session training with sensors.
In particular, the SmartBench reads and elaborates the data that come from three different sensors:
- gym weights: monitor variation of weights.
- barbell: monitor repetition (barbell lifted up and down) and if the barbell is placed in the initial position. 
- bracelet: monitor heartbeat and heart rate.


SmartBench project in which the atlete can monitor his physical condition and collects data thanks to Mosquitto using MQTT protocol
